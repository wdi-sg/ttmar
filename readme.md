# Take the Money and Run!

**Do Not Touch Anything in the `body` tag.** You are only allowed to write code in javascript.

## Write some JS to do the following

- When the first link on the page is clicked, the background color should change to something that is **not** white, blue, or black.

- When the second through fifth links are clicked, the relevant part of the song should be displayed.

> Remember to use `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', doSomething);` or you might have a bad time.

## BONUS!
- When the last link is clicked, one line of the chorus should be displayed. Each subsequent click should display an additional line of the chorus until all 6 lines are displayed.

## BONUS 2
- For each click, the background color changes to a random color.

## BONUS 3
- Keep count of the total number of clicks, and alert the user when they get to five clicks.



## BONUS 4
- For each click the background color changes to a random color, then changes back after 5 seconds.

## BONUS 5
- Let the user enter the name of the element to reveal through an HTML input. Use a button to submit the input. (Hint: you won't need an `event` parameter in your callback for this.)

## BONUS 5.5 
- Let the user know when they've entered the name of an element that doesn't exist.
